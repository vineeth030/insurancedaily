Its a fact, it's part of the law. But an insurance policy suitable for you can help you save your hard-earned money.

A car insurance policy can protect you from property damage or bodily injury liability, roadside assistance, etc.

So how do we choose one for us? It is a frustrating task because there are over 300 insurance companies in the US.

We can’t check the website of all of them, it's not practical. So what do the experts say on this?

According to exerts, we need to at-least compare 3 insurance companies, also you can even choose a state-level company if it better reviews.

What can I do about it? I can give a list of best 5 insurance companies to make your job easier. This listing is from a study by US Auto Insurance considering factors like a billing process, policy offerings, claims, price.”
